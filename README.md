# archlinux-setup

It is a simple Bash script developed to Arch linux post installation on my Acer Nitro 5 1660

Currently these scripts are for me but maybe they are useful for you too.

For new features, improvements and bugs fill an issue in GitHub or make a pull request. You can test it in a virtual machine (strongly recommended) like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) before run it in real hardware.

### Run the command below to start the script:

```bash
./startup.sh
```
