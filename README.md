It is a simple Bash script developed to Arch linux post installation

Currently these scripts are for me but maybe they are useful for you too.

For new features, improvements and bugs fill an issue in GitHub or make a pull request. You can test it in a virtual machine (strongly recommended) like [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) before run it in real hardware.

### Run the command below to start the script:

```bash
./startup.sh
```
